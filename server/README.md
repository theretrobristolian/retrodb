# Server build

This directory contains standalone Linux host provisioning for RetroDB.

## Supported targets

- Debian Stable — primary
- Ubuntu Server LTS — secondary

The bootstrap requires systemd and APT. RetroNAS follows the same broad Debian-family, Bash and Ansible model, keeping a future integration path straightforward.

## Prepare a minimal Debian installation

A minimal Debian installation may not include `sudo`. Become root, install it and add the normal administrator account to the `sudo` group. Replace `david` with the account created during installation when necessary:

```bash
su -c 'apt update && apt install -y sudo && /usr/sbin/usermod -aG sudo david'
su -c '/usr/sbin/reboot'
```

Reconnect so the new group membership applies, update the complete base OS, remove obsolete packages and reboot:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove --purge -y
sudo reboot
```

Reconnect again before continuing.

## Installation sequence

Install Git, clone RetroDB and enter the repository:

```bash
sudo apt install -y git
git clone https://github.com/theretrobristolian/retrodb.git
cd retrodb
```

Run the read-only preflight first:

```bash
sudo bash server/build.sh --check
```

On a new Debian host, warnings about missing packages, the `retrodb` account and its directories are expected. Apply the build and then validate the finished state:

```bash
sudo bash server/build.sh
sudo bash server/build.sh --check
```

The final check should report that all base packages are installed, PostgreSQL is running, and no account or directory warnings remain.

The default run is idempotent: rerunning it restores required packages, accounts, directories, ownership and the PostgreSQL loopback setting.

## Output and diagnostics

Normal output is deliberately concise:

```text
[RUN] Installing base dependencies...
[OK]  Installing base dependencies
```

Underlying command output is captured. If a step fails, the step is marked `[FAILED]` and the captured diagnostic output is displayed automatically.

Use `--verbose` when live APT, PostgreSQL and system command output is needed:

```bash
sudo bash server/build.sh --verbose
```

`--check` remains read-only and can be combined with `--verbose`, although the check itself normally produces little underlying output.

## Application deployment

After the host bootstrap passes its check, deploy the application foundation:

```bash
git pull
sudo bash server/build.sh
sudo bash server/deploy.sh
```

The build step now includes `rsync`, which the deployment uses to copy the checked-out release into `/opt/retrodb`.

The deployment:

- generates a random PostgreSQL password when one does not already exist
- stores the database URL only in `/etc/retrodb/retrodb.env`
- creates the `retrodb` PostgreSQL role and database
- synchronises application files into `/opt/retrodb`
- creates an isolated Python virtual environment
- installs the pinned production dependencies
- applies Alembic migrations
- installs and starts the hardened systemd service
- calls the database-backed health endpoint

Normal output is concise. Add `--verbose` to display all underlying commands:

```bash
sudo bash server/deploy.sh --verbose
```

Validate the running service locally:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/live
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
sudo systemctl status retrodb
```

The service deliberately binds only to loopback. LAN or guest access will be added later through a separately hardened HTTPS reverse proxy.

## RetroAchievements credentials

The deployment adds a labelled RetroAchievements section to the protected configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/retrodb/retrodb.env
```

Enter only the account username and Web API key:

```text
RETRODB_RA_USERNAME=
RETRODB_RA_API_KEY=
```

See the [full credential setup guide](../docs/retroachievements-setup.md), including where to obtain the correct key and where redacted screenshots belong.

After saving the credentials and restarting RetroDB, test the connection and cache the achievement-enabled PlayStation and PlayStation 2 catalogues:

```bash
sudo bash server/retroachievements.sh test
sudo bash server/retroachievements.sh sync
```

The sync requests supported hashes and caches the response for 180 days. Use `sync --force` only for an intentional upstream refresh. Credentials are read from the protected file and are never placed on the command line or written to the cache.

## Security boundary

The bootstrap creates a non-login service user, protects configuration and data paths, and keeps PostgreSQL on loopback. It deliberately does not configure a firewall, mount collection shares, publish a port or place the application on the Internet.

Future work will add database creation, versioned application deployment, systemd units, migrations, health checks, backup/restore verification, reverse-proxy configuration and rollback handling.
