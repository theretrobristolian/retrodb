# Server build

This directory contains standalone Linux host provisioning for RetroDB.

## Supported targets

- Debian Stable — primary
- Ubuntu Server LTS — secondary

The bootstrap requires systemd and APT. RetroNAS follows the same broad Debian-family, Bash and Ansible model, keeping a future integration path straightforward.

## Usage

```bash
sudo bash server/build.sh --check
sudo bash server/build.sh
```

The default run is idempotent: rerunning it restores required packages, accounts, directories, ownership and the PostgreSQL loopback setting.

## Security boundary

The bootstrap creates a non-login service user, protects configuration and data paths, and keeps PostgreSQL on loopback. It deliberately does not configure a firewall, mount collection shares, publish a port or place the application on the Internet.

Future work will add database creation, versioned application deployment, systemd units, migrations, health checks, backup/restore verification, reverse-proxy configuration and rollback handling.
