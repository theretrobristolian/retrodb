# Server build

This directory contains standalone Linux host provisioning for RetroDB.

## Supported targets

- Debian Stable — primary
- Ubuntu Server LTS — secondary

The bootstrap requires systemd and APT. RetroNAS follows the same broad Debian-family, Bash and Ansible model, keeping a future integration path straightforward.

## Prepare a minimal Debian installation

A minimal Debian installation may not include `sudo`. Become root, install it and add the normal administrator account to the `sudo` group. Replace `david` with the account created during installation when necessary:

```bash
su -c 'apt update && apt install -y sudo && /usr/sbin/usermod -aG sudo david'
su -c '/usr/sbin/reboot'
```

Reconnect so the new group membership applies, update the complete base OS, remove obsolete packages and reboot:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove --purge -y
sudo reboot
```

Reconnect again before continuing.

## Usage

```bash
sudo bash server/build.sh --check
sudo bash server/build.sh
```

The default run is idempotent: rerunning it restores required packages, accounts, directories, ownership and the PostgreSQL loopback setting.

## Security boundary

The bootstrap creates a non-login service user, protects configuration and data paths, and keeps PostgreSQL on loopback. It deliberately does not configure a firewall, mount collection shares, publish a port or place the application on the Internet.

Future work will add database creation, versioned application deployment, systemd units, migrations, health checks, backup/restore verification, reverse-proxy configuration and rollback handling.
